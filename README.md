## Purpose
To find meaningful insights by breaking down the series into seasons and even episodes. Attempt to create a classification system to determine which character would say a given line and identify speech sentiment. Identifying which characters were more positive or negative.

## Synopsis
<details><summary></summary>
Looking into dialogue line distribution and number of words per line it became very apparent that the show seemed to lean most heavily upon the character Tyrion who fairly consistently held the highest number of lines and most words spoken per season and often times per episode. The sheer number of unique characters that appear throughout the series proved to be a problem when trying to model for individual character identification as this ultimately reduced our data based upon the characters we were trying to classify. Initial modeling attemps provided overall accuracy around 24% for our characters with the most lines. Changing methods to classification by family name improved our results up to around 50% and removing all but the Lannisters and Starks gave us an accuracy of around 68%. As for sentiment analysis, most characters seem to average out to being mostly neutral with Sandor Clegane averaging out to be the most typically negative character and both Petyr Baelish and Varys being the most typically postive. Interestingly enough, Tywin Lannister also proved to be almost perfectly neutral.
